### Hi there! I am Caio Baptista.


- 🎓 I am studying the third year of my PhD in Applied Economics at UFJF/PUC-Rio. My thesis seeks to develop statistical, microeconometric and machine learning models that model climate risks within credit risk models. I am currently studying machine learning and deep learning and developing my doctoral thesis at the Economics Department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, a center of excellence in Brazil (CAPES 7 concept).

- 😍 I am passionate about Statistics, Econometrics, Machine Learning and Data Science. 

- 👣 I have 5 years of experience in statistical/econometric modeling and 2 years of experience in machine learning. I was a monitor professor of statistics/applied econometrics with R for the Graduate Program in Applied Economics at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora.

- 🔭 I have been studying Data Science for 2 years, focusing a lot on the theory of machine learning algorithms and their application to solve economic problems. I have also been studying MLOps (FastAPI, Flask, PaaS, IaaS, Cloud, Docker, CI/CD).

- 🧑‍💻 I have experience in programming languages like Python, R, Excel, Stata and I'm learning SQL.

- 💬 Ask me about Statistics, Econometrics, Machine Learning and Data Science.
