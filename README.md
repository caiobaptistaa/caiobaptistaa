### Hi there! I am Caio Baptista.


- 🎓 I am studying the third year of my PhD in Applied Economics at UFJF/PUC-Rio. My thesis seeks to develop statistical, microeconometric and machine learning models that model climate risks in credit risk analysis models. I am currently studying machine learning and deep learning and developing my doctoral thesis at the Department of Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, a center of excellence in Brazil (CAPES 7 concept).

- 😍 I am passionate about turning data into business solutions. 

- 👣 I have a strong background in statistics and 5 years of experience in statistical and econometric modeling and 2 years of experience in machine learning. I was a monitor professor of statistics and applied econometrics with R for the Graduate Program in Applied Economics at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. 

- 🔭 I've been studying Data Science for 2 years, focusing a lot on the theory of machine learning algorithms and their application to solve economic problems. I have also been studying MLOps for 3 months and I aim to acquire skills such as implementing and monitoring models in production (FastAPI, Flask, PaaS, IaaS, Cloud, Docker, CI/CD).

- 🧑‍💻 I have experience in programming languages like Python, R, Excel, Stata and I'm learning SQL.

- 👔 I seek to pursue a career in Data Science in order to collaborate with modeling (Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Optimization, Pipelines) and improve my knowledge in model deployment (FastAPI, Flask, PaaS, IaaS, Cloud, Docker, CI/CD).

- 💬 Ask me about Statistics, Econometrics, Machine Learning and Data Science.
